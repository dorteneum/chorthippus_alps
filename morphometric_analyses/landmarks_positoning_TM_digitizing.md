**Table List of landmarks and semilandmarks, descriptions, and instructions for digitizing**
ID	| Description	| Tip for digitizing
----|---------------|---------------------
1	| Vertex of the anal area |	The “edge” of the proximal end of the wing
2	| base of the subcostal vein |	Where the subcostal vein disappears at the base of the wing
3	| end of the subcostal vein |	End of the bottom straight line; tip of a triangle
4	| base of the costal and radial veins	| Where costal and radial veins disappear at base of the wing
5	| tip  of the radial vein |	Where the straight line of the radial vein ends at the tip of wing
6	| interaction of second branch of medial vein with margin of the wing	| End of the bottom branch of medial vein at tip of wing
7	| bifurcation of medial vein | 	Bottom point of “triangle”, before double rows of cells start
8	| tip of medial vein|	Where straight line of medial vein ends at tip of wing
9	| tip of anal vein |	End of anal vein, tip of triangle
10	| bifurcation of  cubital vein |	Top point of “triangle”, before double rows of cells start
11	| intersection between bifurcations of medial and cubital vein |	Middle point/tip of “triangle”, before double rows of cells start
12	| tip of cubital vein 1	| Where the straight line of the cubital vein ends
13	| bifurcation of cubital vein 1	 |Where the first branching of the cubital vein starts
14	| intersection between cubital vein 2 and postcubital vein	 | Where cubital vein 2 ends and interacts with postcubital vein (parallel to anal vein)
15	| bifurcation of anal vein	| Tip of a triangle by branching of anal vein
SL 16-34	| medial vein	| The vein in the middle of the wing that meets landmark 7; above stigma
SL 35-52	| radial vein	| The vein that extends below the stigma
SL 53-70	| subcostal vein	| The vein that ends in a triangle at bottom of wing
SL 71-93	| costal vein	| The vein that ends in a triangle at bottom of wing and is above the precostal zone
