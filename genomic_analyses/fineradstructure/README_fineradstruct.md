# 4. Population structure analysis: admixture between species

In addition to EMU PCA, we employed the fineRADstructure software to further investigate the population structure of our taxa and assess the level of admixture between species.

For this analysis, we used the **dataset B** (*Alps_fmdi-geno50imiss70.recode.vcf*).

## II) FineRADstructure installation

First of all, it's essential to be aware of the required libraries and their versions to install fineRADstructure in conda (https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/fineradstructure/README.html):
- gsl >=2.7 and <2.8.0a0
- libgcc-ng >=12
- libstdcxx-ng >=12
- libzlib >=1.2.13 
- zlib >=1.2.13 

**Important**: Do NOT clone the program with `git clone https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure`. It does not work well like that.

We also checked the possibility of installing fineradstructure directly (paying attention to the versions of the libraries). As it did not work either, we followed the next instructions. 

A new conda environment was created with the gsl program installed and activated it.

```
conda create -n finerstruct gsl
conda activate finerstruct
```
We installed the necessary libraries/programs and fineradstructure.
```
conda install -c anaconda libgcc-ng
conda install -c anaconda libgcc-ng=13.1
conda install -c anaconda libstdcxx-ng=13.1
conda install libzlib zlib -c conda-forge

conda install fineradstructure -c bioconda
```

This website helped us solve the errors encountered during the installation: https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure/issues/1

Once fineradstructure was installed, the *fineRADstructurePlot.R* and *FinestructureLibrary.R* files appeared in our folder.


## III) Step by step guidelines

The fineRADstructure analysis consisted of the following five steps:
1. Conversion of the dataset B from .vcf format to .finerad input format.
2. Calculation of the co-ancestry matrix.
3. Assignation of individuals to populations.
4. Building the tree.
5. Creating plots depicting the population structure.

**Important**: each command line (step) was executed on a different script or different line.

For help and further information for running fineRADstructure, refer to the documentation ... [linktodocumentation]


### 1. Conversion of dataset B from .vcf format to .finerad input format

The *finerad_convert_inputfile.sh* sbatch script was run.

```
RADpainter hapsFromVCF /dss/dsshome1/0A/ra93rey/fineradstruct/Alps_fmdi-geno50imiss70.recode.vcf
```

The output from sbatch resulted in the .finerad input file format for the next step. The name of the file  was changed. Here, it was altered to "Alps_dsB_paper".


### 2. Calculation of the co-ancestry matrix

The *finerad_coamatrix.sh* sbatch script was run.

```
RADpainter paint Alps_dsB_paper.finerad
```

The output file generated was *Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.out*, which served as the input file of the next step.


### 3. Assignment of the individuals to populations (MCMC step)

The *finerad_popasg.sh* sbatch script was executed.

```
finestructure -x 100000 -y 100000 -z 1000 Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.out Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.mcmc.xml
```
The output files included *Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.mcmc.xml*, one of the input files for the next step.


### 4. Creation of the clustering tree

The *finerad_treebuild.sh* sbatch script was run.

```
finestructure -m T -x 10000 Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.out Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.mcmc.xml Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.mcmcTree.xml
```
We obtained *Alps_dsB_paper_chunks.mcmcTree.xml* as output file.


### 5. Creation of the population structure plots

The R script *fineRADstructurePlot.R* was executed to obtain three types of plots:
- the simple coancestry matrix: *Alps_dsB_paper_frs-SimpleCoancestry.pdf*
- the populations and coancestry averages: *Alps_dsB_paper_frs-PopAveragedCoancestry.pdf*
- the populations and coancestry averages with perhaps more informatives labels: *Alps_dsB_paper_frs-PopAveragedCoancestry2.pdf*

To customize the plots, other software such as Inkscape were utilized.

The *Figure_fineRADstruct_paper.\*\*\** plot was obtained in pdf and svg format, depicting the populations and coancestry averages.
