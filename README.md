# Clarifying diversity in the radiation of Chorthippus grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) through an integration of genomic and morphometric approaches

This repository contains all required code and scripts to do the morphometric and genomic analysis that were carried out for the scientific publication titled "_Clarifying diversity in the radiation of _Chorthippus_ grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) through an integration of genomic and morphometric approaches_".   

This repository contains two folders divived based on the genomics or morphometric portions of the analysis.  

Data regarding morphometric analysis and genome sequences can be found as follows:
1. The **pictures of the grasshopper forewings**: [OSF Chorthippus Alps](https://osf.io/mzy57/)  
2. **Linked genomic data - NCBI SRA Accession number**: BioProject PRJNA1271307
