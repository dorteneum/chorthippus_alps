# Clarifying diversity in the radiation of Chorthippus grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) through an integration of genomic and morphometric approaches

This repository contains all required code and scripts to do the morphometric and genomic analysis that were carried out for the scientific publication titled "Clarifying diversity in the radiation of _Chorthippus_ grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) through an integration of genomic and morphometric approaches".   

We have two folders divived based on the genomics or morphometric portions of the analysis.  

The pictures of the grasshopper forewings used for the morphometric analyses can be found in the following public repository: LINK  
The genomic data used for this study can be found in the following public NCBI repository: LINK
